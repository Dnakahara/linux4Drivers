Linux Device Drivers 3rd edition

Example code in the book were written some years before.
The book's code are based on Linux2.6, but now, Linux kernel are
developed and go well in these years so latest version reaches 
Linux4.12(now).

Thus we can't build the examples on the latest kernel.

This repository offers newer examples for Linux4.10.
